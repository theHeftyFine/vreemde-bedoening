        <h1>So I'm building a personal website from scratch</h1>
        <p>
            There are multiple reasons why I chose to start this project. First and foremost is to have a place to write and share my thoughts.
            I'm not that good of a writer, and even starting to write this bit of text feels like a chore. English being my second language definitely doesn't help.
            So in the interest of honing ones skill by doing, I'm just going to start writing these posts, and hope I'll get better as I go along.
        </p>
        <p>
            Secondly, I just feel like I should be able to do this. I've been working in web development for almost 9 years now, honing my skills in many web framework,
            and helping many companies see their web applications come to fruition. And yet I have no presence on the web myself. What gives?
        </p>
        <p>
            And lastly, and this is one I'll be expanding on as I learn more... I feel jaded with the current state of the internet. As a child of the nineties,
            I've seen the internet grow from a wonderful hodgepodge of personal websites, forums, and janky brand pages, to the corporate-run, data-drinking, privacy killing, walled garden hellscape
            of social media it turned in to today.
        </p>
        <p>
            Luckily, it seems I'm not alone in this frustration. In fact, I'm probably even late to the party! For more than 10 years already, <a href="https://neocities.org">Neocities</a>
            has been empowering users to build oldschool geocities style websites, with modern discoverability. And the ever expanding <a href="https://jointhefediverse.net/learn">fediverse</a> is completely reimagining digital
            ownership of social media spaces.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to finally join these ranks of pioneers of the old web, and return to a social space that is more truly mine. Just me,
            my webhost, and my domain registrar. And definitely no Muskrats or Sucky Bergs! If you found me, it means I've at least got the blog
            part up and running, and I already have some interesting steps on my journey that I would like to share with you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Up next, I'd like to share the steps I had to take to even get this server up and running, up to and including setting up a custom domain name, and the fancy lil' TLS lock to the left of your search bar.
            For some this may be basic stuff, but I'd like to write these blogs in a way that anyone can follow along. It's never too late to learn, and I'll hope these posts can be useful to someone.
        </p>
        <p>
            For now, keep your eye on this space, and I'll see you on the other side.
        </p>
        <p>
            Oh, and don't mind the mess... I'm redecorating.
        </p>
        <p>
            - Love, Hefty
